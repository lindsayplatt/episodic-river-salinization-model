# NHDPlus Attributes to use as static attributes

# To explore these and come up with this list, I 
# looked through descriptions of all 4,720 attributes 
# prefixed with `CAT_` using the following code:

# library(tidyverse)
# library(nhdplusTools)
# # Get around the issue I logged at https://github.com/DOI-USGS/nhdplusTools/issues/365
# nhdplusTools::nhdplusTools_data_dir(tools::R_user_dir("nhdplusTools"))
# nhdplus_descriptions <- get_characteristics_metadata() %>%
#   split(.$themeLabel) %>%
#   map(~{
#     # CAT = catchment
#     # ACC = accumulated using divergent routing
#     # TOT = accumulated using total upstream
#     # Using `CAT`
#     dplyr::select(.x, ID, description) %>%
#       filter(grepl('^CAT_', ID))
#   })

Best Management Practices:
  # NONE

Chemical:
  # NONE
  # Consider atmospheric deposition of chloride in the future?

Climate:
  # NONE
  - CAT_PPT7100_ANN # mean annual precip, mm (1971-2000)
  - CAT_PRSNOW # Snow percent of total precipitation estimate, mean for period 1901-2000.
  - CAT_TAV7100_DEC # mean December air temp, mm (1971-2000)
  - CAT_TAV7100_JAN # mean January air temp, mm (1971-2000)
  - CAT_TAV7100_FEB # mean February air temp, mm (1971-2000)
  - CAT_TAV7100_MAR # mean March air temp, mm (1971-2000)

Climate and Water Balance:
  # NONE

Climate Water Balance:
  # NONE
  # This includes a timeseries of mean monthly (precip, temp, runoff, etc) per year in model
  # Don't need those though, we are capturing those vars as single, static values per reach

Geology:
  # NONE
  # This includes rock stuff - there is a lot info about rock types and thickness of 
  # different surficial materials. There is also info about Principal Aquifers and 
  # rock hydraulic conductivity. Could consider adding some of these later

Hydrologic:
  - CAT_BFI # baseflow index, % of baseflow to total streamflow
  - CAT_CONTACT # number of days that infiltrated water resides in the saturated subsurface zone of the basin before discharging into the stream)
  - CAT_RECHG # mean annual GW recharge

Hydrologic Modifications:
  # NONE

Land Cover:
  # I filtered to NLCD 2019 options but there are many years represented
  - CAT_NLCD19_11 # NLCD 2019 "Open Water"
  - CAT_NLCD19_21 # NLCD 2019 "Developed, Open" which equals <20% impervious
  - CAT_NLCD19_22 # NLCD 2019 "Developed, low intensity" which equals 20-49% impervious
  - CAT_NLCD19_23 # NLCD 2019 "Developed, medium intensity" which equals 50-79% impervious
  - CAT_NLCD19_24 # NLCD 2019 "Developed, high intensity" which equals 80-100% impervious
  - CAT_NLCD19_41 # Deciduous Forest
  - CAT_NLCD19_42 # Evergreen Forest
  - CAT_NLCD19_43 # Mixed Forest
  - CAT_NLCD19_81 # Pasture/Hay
  - CAT_NLCD19_82 # Cultivated Crops
  - CAT_NLCD19_90 # Woody Wetlands
  - CAT_NLCD19_95 # Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands

Population:
  # NONE
  # The impervious land cover and road density attributes are better measures for our purposes

Regions:
  # NONE

Soils:
  # NONE

Topographic:
  - CAT_BASIN_SLOPE # avg basin slope, %

Water Use:
  # NONE
